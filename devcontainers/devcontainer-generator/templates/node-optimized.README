## Node.js (Optimized Multi-Stage Build)

This container includes Node.js {NODE_VERSION} with Yarn {YARN_VERSION} installed using an optimized multi-stage build approach.

### Features

- Reduced image size through multi-stage builds
- Separation of build-time and runtime dependencies
- Improved caching for faster rebuilds
- Non-root user for better security

### Usage

The Node.js environment is configured with:
- Node.js {NODE_VERSION}
- Yarn {YARN_VERSION}
- Common build tools for native modules

### Benefits of the Optimized Build

This optimized Node.js setup provides several advantages over the standard approach:

1. **Smaller image size**: Only necessary runtime dependencies are included in the final image
2. **Better security**: Reduced attack surface by excluding build tools from the runtime image
3. **Improved caching**: Better layer organization for more efficient Docker caching
4. **Faster builds**: Dependencies are cached separately from application code
