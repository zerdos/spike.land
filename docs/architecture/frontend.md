# Frontend Architecture

The frontend is divided into two main parts:

-   **Editor Interface (Main Window):** Provides the user interface for coding and editing.
-   **Code Execution Environment (Iframe):** Executes the userâ€™s code in an isolated context.

## Components

### Main Window (Editor)

-   **Editor Interface:** Utilizes Monaco Editor for a rich coding experience.
    -   Configured with TypeScript language support, code formatting, and autocompletion.
    -   Uses a custom theme for improved readability.
-   **Code Processing:** Performs initial formatting and transpilation before sending code for execution.
    -   Uses `prettier` for code formatting.
    -   Uses `esbuild` for code transpilation.
-   **Message Handling:** Uses `postMessage` to communicate with the iframe and ensures that only messages from the designated iframe are acted upon, preventing unintended re-rendering in the main window.

### Iframe (Execution Environment)

-   **Code Execution:** Safely executes user code in isolation.
-   **Render Service:** Updates the UI based on executed code, completely isolated from the main window.
-   **WebSocket Interaction:** May manage live updates and state synchronization specific to the execution context.

## Other Components

### DraggableWindow

-   Provides a draggable and resizable window for the iframe.
-   Uses `framer-motion` for smooth animations and transitions.

### RainbowWrapper

-   Provides a visually appealing wrapper around the editor.
-   Uses CSS gradients and animations to create a dynamic background.

### ContextViewer

-   Displays the current context of the application

## Communication Flow

1.  The user modifies code in the editor.
2.  The code is formatted and transpiled.
3.  The processed code is sent via `postMessage` to the iframe.
4.  The iframe processes and executes the code, then sends the result back.
5.  The main window updates its UI based solely on verified messages from the iframe.

## Test Environment Considerations

-   **Polyfills:** A polyfill for `window.scrollTo` is setup in the test environment (see `start.ts`) to prevent errors.
-   **Stubbed Code Processing:** In tests, the `CodeProcessor` is stubbed to immediately return "processed_test" to avoid timeouts.
-   **Service Worker Configuration:** The `ServiceWorkerManager` is configured to skip setup when simulating an iframe (using a global flag) or when running outside the main window.
-   **Mocking Strategy:** Key functions like `formatCode` and `transpileCode` are stubbed/mocked in tests to ensure prompt and predictable behavior.

## Security and Best Practices

-   **Isolation:** Code execution is confined to the iframe, ensuring a secure separation from the main window.
-   **Validation:** Incoming messages are validated to accept only those from the trusted iframe source.
-   **CSP Compliance:** Content Security Policy and origin checks are implemented to safeguard against unauthorized interactions.
