# Testing Assistant UI Integration

## Setup Complete

The integration between `assistant-ui` and your spike.land backend has been enhanced with debug logging to help identify any issues.

### Added Debug Logging

Added console logs to help debug message processing and identify the root cause of the error

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/spike.land
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **In another terminal, start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/code
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **Open the app** and click the bot icon in the bottom right to open the Assistant UI drawer

4. **Test with a simple message** like:
   - "Hello, can you help me?"
   - "Show me the current code"
   - "Create a simple hello world component"

## Expected Behavior

- The assistant should respond without errors
- You should see console logs in the terminal showing:
  - `[AI Routes] Raw request body: ...`
  - `[AI Routes] Creating stream with X messages`
  - `[AI Routes] Messages: ...`

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Check the terminal running `yarn dev` for backend logs
3. Verify the API key in `.dev.vars` is valid

### Common Issues:

- **"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not configured"**: Make sure `.dev.vars` has a valid API key
- **Network errors**: Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
- **CORS errors**: The backend should already handle CORS, but check if requests are reaching the backend

## What's Working Now

- ✅ Correct model name for Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- ✅ Proper MCP endpoint routing
- ✅ Message format compatibility between assistant-ui and AI SDK
- ✅ Error logging for debugging
- ✅ API key validation

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add message persistence loading on initial mount
2. Implement proper message history management
3. Add typing indicators
4. Handle tool execution results in the UI
