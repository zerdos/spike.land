# spike.land - Main Cloudflare Worker Backend

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD--3--Clause-blue.svg)](../../LICENSE.md)

This is the main backend for spike.land, a Cloudflare Workers-based application.
It provides real-time collaboration features, a comprehensive suite of API
services including AI integrations, and robust static asset hosting.

## Overview

## Features

- Real-time collaboration using Durable Objects
- Static file serving with KV storage
- Authentication with Clerk
- AI integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Whisper)
- WebRTC TURN server
- CMS functionality
- Asset versioning and caching

## Architecture

### Static File Handling

- Cloudflare KV storage for static files
- `getAssetFromKV` for efficient asset retrieval
- Custom `serveWithCache` implementation
- Asset versioning with `ASSET_MANIFEST` and `ASSET_HASH`
- Content-Type header management

## API Reference

### Service Worker Endpoints

- `GET /swVersion.mjs` - Current service worker version
- `GET /swVersion.js` - Service worker version and files info
- `GET /sw-config.json` - Service worker configuration
- `GET /ASSET_MANIFEST` - Asset manifest

### AI Integration Endpoints

- `POST /transpile` - Code transpilation using esbuild
- `POST /anthropic` - Anthropic AI requests
- `GET /ai-logs` - Recent AI logs
- `POST /openai` - OpenAI GPT-4 requests
- `POST /whisper` - Audio transcription
- `POST /summarize` - Text summarization
- `POST /replicate` - Replicate AI requests

### Authentication & WebRTC

- `GET /api/logged_in` - JWT token verification
- `GET /api/my-turn` - WebRTC TURN credentials

### CMS Operations

- `/my-cms/` - Personal CMS operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- `/live-cms/` - Live CMS operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret
```

For local development, create a `.dev.vars` file with these variables.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Cloudflare Workers account
- Wrangler CLI installed
- Durable Objects enabled
- KV namespace created

### Available Scripts

#### Development

- `yarn dev` - Start local development server
- `yarn dev:remote` - Start development server with remote connections

#### Building

- `yarn build:worker` - While this script might show 'No build required' or
  simply execute a placeholder, the actual bundling of the worker from an entry
  point (e.g., `./src/cf-workers.ts`) is handled by Wrangler during the
  deployment process (e.g., when running `yarn deploy:dev` or
  `yarn deploy:prod`).

#### Deployment

- `yarn deploy:dev` - Deploy to development environment (testing)
- `yarn deploy:prod` - Deploy to production environment

#### Testing

- `yarn test:api` - Run the full API test suite, including type checking,
  linting, and unit tests. This is the most comprehensive test script.
- `yarn test:unit` - Run unit tests only.
- `yarn test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode

#### Types & Utils

- `yarn types:check` - Type check without emitting files
- `yarn clean` - Clean build artifacts

### Local Development

1. Set up environment variables in `.dev.vars`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret
```

2. Start local development server:

```bash
# For local development
yarn dev

# For remote development
yarn dev:remote
```

3. Test your changes:

```bash
# Run tests once
yarn test:api

# Or run unit tests only
yarn test:unit

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch
```

4. Deploy:

```bash
# Deploy to development environment
yarn deploy:dev

# Deploy to production
yarn deploy:prod
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Durable Objects not working:**
   - Verify Durable Objects are enabled in your account
   - Check wrangler.toml configuration

2. **KV access issues:**
   - Ensure KV namespace is properly bound
   - Verify KV access permissions

3. **Authentication errors:**
   - Check Clerk configuration
   - Verify JWT token format

4. **Deployment failures:**
   - Run `wrangler whoami` to verify authentication
   - Check for syntax errors with `yarn lint`
