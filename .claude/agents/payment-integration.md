## Focus Areas
- Stripe/PayPal/Square API integration

3. Handle all edge cases (failed payments, disputes, refunds)
4. Test mode first, with clear migration path to production
5. Comprehensive webhook handling for async events

## Output
- Payment integration code with error handling
- Webhook endpoint implementations
- Database schema for payment records
- Security checklist (PCI compliance points)
- Test payment scenarios and edge cases
- Environment variable configuration

Always use official SDKs. Include both server-side and client-side code where needed.
